        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Python a high-level, object-oriented and interpreted programming language which is used to build website and software. It is popular because of the following resons:-\n",
        "    a. It is most significant language for AI & ML.\n",
        "    b. It is easy to learn.\n",
        "    c. It can easily interact with other tools.\n",
        "    d. It has huge number of libraries(pre-written code).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Interpretor is a program that reads and executes the python code line by line.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Pre-defined Keywords are reserved words in Python that have pre-defined meanings and cannot be used as identifiers like variable names or function name.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - No keywords cannot be used as variable names\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Mutability  refers to the ability of an object to be modified after it is created. If the  object is mutable, its internal state can be changed such as adding, removing or updating element without creating a new object.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Lists are mutable as they can be modifies whereas the tuples doesnot allow any modification .\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In python \"==\" operator is used to compare values of two objects whereas the \"is\" operator is used as an identifier which checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory or not .\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Logical operators are operators to evaluate a statement to return either a True or a False.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Type casting  is a concept in programming where you change the data type of a variable from one type to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Implicit type casting.\n",
        "\n",
        "a.The programming language automatically converts data from one type to another if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. It saves time and effort because you don't have to manually convert data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "c. It happens automatically, reducing the chance of errors due to forgetting to convert types.\n",
        "\n",
        "d. Sometimes, when converting between data types, there can be a loss of precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Explicit type casting\n",
        "\n",
        "a. In this type of casting the programmer explicitly instructs the compiler to convert a data type to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. It gives  the programmer more control over the conversion process, allowing for precise manipulation of data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "c. It can introduce complexity to the code, especially when dealing with multiple data type conversions.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A conditional statement is used to  determine the flow of code execution and its direction based on certain conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In elif condition if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "ex.\n",
        "a = 30\n",
        "b = 31\n",
        "if b > a:\n",
        "  print(\"b is greater than a\")\n",
        "elif a == b:\n",
        "  print(\"a is equal to b\")\n",
        "else:\n",
        "  print(\"a is greater\")\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The for loops is best suited for the situations where you know exactly how many times the loop will execute whereas the while situations are dyanmic and are used where the iterations is unknown.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for    loop?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Imagine a situation where you are reading data from a file until you reach the end. You don't know how many lines the file contains, so you need a loop that keeps reading line by line until there are no more lines to read. In such a case, a \"While Loop\" is more appropriate because the number of iterations needed isn't known in advance,it depends on the file's content.\n",
